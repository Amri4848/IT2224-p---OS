Q)

Read three numbers ( a,b,c ) from the user and store then into 
three variables. Find the LCM from the first two numbers(a,b) and the GCM for the 
second two numbers(b,c)

---ANS---    (LCMGCM.sh)	
			 
Code:
 
echo "Enter number a: "
read a
echo "Enter number b: "
read b
echo "Enter number c: "
read c

x=$a
y=$b
while [ $y -ne 0 ]; do
    temp=$y
    y=$((x % y))
    x=$temp
done
gcd_ab=$x

lcm_ab=$(( (a * b) / gcd_ab ))

x=$b
y=$c
while [ $y -ne 0 ]; do
    temp=$y
    y=$((x % y))
    x=$temp
done
gcd_bc=$x

echo "LCM of $a and $b is: $lcm_ab"
echo "GCD of $b and $c is: $gcd_bc"
